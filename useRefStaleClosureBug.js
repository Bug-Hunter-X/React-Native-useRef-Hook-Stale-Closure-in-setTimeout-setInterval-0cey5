This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native and attempting to access its current value within a function passed to a `setTimeout` or `setInterval` function. Because the closure created by the function passed to `setTimeout` or `setInterval` captures a snapshot of the `ref`'s value at the time of function creation, any subsequent updates to the `ref`'s value are not reflected within this closure, leading to stale closures or unexpected behavior.
